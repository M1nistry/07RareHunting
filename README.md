Runescape 2007 Rare Hunting Tool

Information
=======

This tool allows for all players who are interested in hunting the current rare holiday items in a more effective way.
Previously leaders of a Clan Chat channel would have to keep a note on which spawns were free/which were occupied and
share this information constantly with whoever is looking for a spawn. Also sometimes doing a 'roll call' to try get
each player to report which spawn they were at.

With this tool, a user can visually see which spawns are occupied and which are free, allowing players to more effectively
hunt and find a rare item.

Instructions
========

Launch the program, input your characters name and which spawn you are currently occupying.
Wait until the status label displays 'Connected', tick Active and click Update. This will tell the server you are active
and to share your information with all other clients and allow your client to see everyone elses locations.

Every 5 minutes you're required to re-click update to tell the server that you're still actively camping that spawn.
This prevents leaving a characters data in the table even though they've gone to bed or AFK and aren't camping anymore.
